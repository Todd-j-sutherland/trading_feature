# 🔧 ML Model Version Error - Complete Fix Guide

## 📋 Problem Summary

**Error**: `"Error loading model version: 'version'"`

**Root Cause**: The MLTrainingPipeline was trying to access `metadata['version']` from metadata files that didn't contain a `version` key.

## ✅ Local Fix Applied

1. **Enhanced the `get_latest_model_version()` method** in `app/core/ml/training/pipeline.py`:
   - Added multiple fallback paths for metadata files
   - Added graceful handling for missing `version` keys
   - Added automatic version generation from `training_date` or `created_at`
   - Added comprehensive error logging

2. **Fixed all local metadata files** to include proper `version` keys

## 🌐 Remote Environment Fix

Since you're seeing this error remotely, run these commands on the remote server:

### Step 1: Connect to Remote
```bash
ssh root@170.64.199.151
cd /root/test
source ../trading_venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Run the Automated Fix Script
```bash
# Copy the script to remote and run it
python check_metadata.py
```

### Step 3: Manual Fix (if needed)
If the automated script isn't available, manually check and fix:

```bash
# Find all metadata files
find . -name "current_metadata.json"

# Check each file for version key
grep -l "version" ./data/ml_models/current_metadata.json
grep -l "version" ./data/ml_models/models/current_metadata.json
```

If any file is missing the `version` key, add it:

```json
{
  "version": "v_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS",
  // ... rest of the metadata
}
```

### Step 4: Copy Fixed Files from Local
From your local machine, you can also copy the fixed files:

```bash
# Run the automated remote fix script
./fix_remote_metadata.sh
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

After applying the fix, test the morning routine:

```bash
# On remote
cd /root/test
source ../trading_venv/bin/activate
python -m app.main morning
```

## 📁 Files Modified

1. `app/core/ml/training/pipeline.py` - Enhanced `get_latest_model_version()` method
2. `data/ml_models/current_metadata.json` - Added version key
3. `check_metadata.py` - New utility to verify/fix metadata files
4. `fix_remote_metadata.sh` - Remote deployment script

## 🔍 Verification

The error `"Error loading model version: 'version'"` should no longer appear. Instead, you should see:

```
INFO - Loaded model version 'v_XXXXX' from data/ml_models/current_metadata.json
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **If you still see the error on remote**: Run the metadata checker script
2. **If metadata files are missing on remote**: Copy them from local using the provided script
3. **For future deployments**: Always ensure metadata files have the `version` key

The enhanced pipeline method is now much more robust and will handle various metadata file formats gracefully.
