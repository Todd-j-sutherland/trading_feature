### 3. Signal Quality Thresholds

#### Current vs Recommended Thresholds
```
Parameter          Current    Recommended    Performance Impact
Confidence Score   ≥0.60      ≥0.80         Win rate: 67.2% → 87.2%
Tech Score         ≥0.40      ≥0.42         100% win rate when >0.45
Volume Score       ≥-40%      ≥-20%         Win rate: 67.2% → 79.7%
```

#### Loss Pattern Analysis
- **56.7%** of losses had confidence < 0.7
- **46.7%** of losses had tech_score < 0.42  
- **40.0%** of losses had volume_score < -30

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Update Signal Thresholds
```python
# Current signal criteria
CONSERVATIVE_THRESHOLDS = {
    'confidence': 0.60,
    'tech_score': 0.40,
    'volume_score': -40.0
}

# Recommended optimized criteria
OPTIMIZED_THRESHOLDS = {
    'confidence': 0.80,      # +87.2% win rate
    'tech_score': 0.42,      # Eliminates 46.7% of losses
    'volume_score': -20.0,   # +79.7% win rate
    'multi_factor': True     # Require ALL thresholds
}
```

#### 1.2 Symbol Filtering Strategy
```python
# Whitelist: Proven performers
APPROVED_SYMBOLS = ['CBA.AX', 'MQG.AX', 'WES.AX']

# Monitor list: Requires investigation
WATCH_SYMBOLS = ['NAB.AX']  # Banking sector anomaly

# Blacklist: Consistent poor performers
EXCLUDED_SYMBOLS = ['ORG.AX', 'QBE.AX']
```

#### 1.3 Time-Based Trading Windows
```python
# Optimal trading hours (UTC)
PRIMARY_HOURS = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]  # 83% of positive returns
SECONDARY_HOURS = [2]            # Monitor only
EXCLUDED_HOURS = [6, 7, 8]       # Avoid unless exceptional
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Risk Management (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Multi-Factor Validation
```python
def validate_signal(signal):
    checks = [
        signal.confidence >= 0.80,
        signal.tech_score >= 0.42,
        signal.volume_score >= -20.0,
        signal.symbol in APPROVED_SYMBOLS,
        signal.hour in PRIMARY_HOURS,
        signal.market_volatility < 2.0  # Daily volatility threshold
    ]
    return all(checks)
```

#### 2.2 Market Context Validation
```python
def market_context_check(symbol):
    """Validate market conditions before trading"""
    market_data = get_recent_market_data(symbol)
    
    # Avoid high volatility environments
    if market_data.daily_volatility > 2.0:
        return False
    
    # Avoid downtrending markets
    if market_data.trend_5day < -1.0:
        return False
        
    # Avoid during significant market stress
    if market_data.asx200_change < -1.5:
        return False
        
    return True
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Week 3+)

#### 3.1 Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
```python
def dynamic_thresholds(market_conditions):
    """Adjust thresholds based on market conditions"""
    base_thresholds = OPTIMIZED_THRESHOLDS.copy()
    
    # Tighten during high volatility
    if market_conditions.volatility > 1.5:
        base_thresholds['confidence'] += 0.05
        base_thresholds['tech_score'] += 0.02
    
    # Adjust for sector performance
    if market_conditions.sector_stress:
        base_thresholds['confidence'] += 0.10
    
    return base_thresholds
```

#### 3.2 Sector-Specific Strategies
```python
SECTOR_STRATEGIES = {
    'banking': {
        'approved': ['CBA.AX'],
        'monitor': ['NAB.AX'],
        'min_confidence': 0.85  # Higher threshold due to mixed results
    },
    'financial_services': {
        'approved': ['MQG.AX'],
        'min_confidence': 0.80
    },
    'consumer_discretionary': {
        'approved': ['WES.AX'],
        'min_confidence': 0.80
    }
}
```

## Machine Learning Integration

### Current ML Training Schedule (from cron analysis)
```bash
# Daily ML training (08:00 UTC)
0 8 * * * cd /root/test && /root/trading_venv/bin/python real_ml_training.py

# Morning analysis (Mon-Fri, 07:00 UTC)  
0 7 * * 1-5 cd /root/test && /root/trading_venv/bin/python enhanced_morning_analyzer_with_ml.py
```

### Recommended ML Enhancements
1. **Symbol-Specific Models:** Train separate models for each approved symbol
2. **Time-Based Features:** Include hour-of-day as a feature
3. **Market Context Features:** Include volatility, trend, and sector performance
4. **Dynamic Retraining:** Retrain models when performance degrades

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements
| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Win Rate | 67.2% | 85%+ | +17.8% |
| Signal Quality | Mixed | High | Consistent |
| Risk-Adjusted Return | Moderate | High | Significant |
| System Reliability | Variable | Stable | Enhanced |

### Risk Reduction

## Monitoring and Validation

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```python
MONITORING_METRICS = {
    'win_rate': {'target': 0.85, 'alert_below': 0.75},
    'avg_return': {'target': 0.005, 'alert_below': 0.003},
    'daily_signals': {'target': 15, 'alert_below': 5},
    'symbol_distribution': {'approved_ratio': 0.90},
    'time_distribution': {'primary_hours_ratio': 0.80}
}
```

### Weekly Review Process
