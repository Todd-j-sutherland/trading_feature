## Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.production

# Configure production credentials
# Edit .env.production with:
# IG_USERNAME=your_live_username
# IG_PASSWORD=your_live_password  
# IG_API_KEY=your_live_api_key
# IG_DEMO=false
```

### Step 2: Test Integration
```bash
# Run comprehensive test
python test_ig_integration.py

# Test main application commands
python -m app.main ig-markets-test
python -m app.main status
python -m app.main morning
```

### Step 3: Monitor Health
```bash
# Check IG Markets connectivity
python -c "
from app.core.data.collectors.enhanced_market_data_collector import EnhancedMarketDataCollector
collector = EnhancedMarketDataCollector()
print('IG Markets Health:', collector.is_ig_markets_healthy())
print('Stats:', collector.get_data_source_stats())
"
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Update production environment
git push production main

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart trading-system
sudo systemctl restart paper-trading

# Verify deployment
python -m app.main status
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **API Health**: IG Markets connectivity percentage
2. **Response Times**: Average API response latency
3. **Error Rates**: Failed requests per hour
4. **Fallback Usage**: Percentage of requests using yfinance
5. **Cache Performance**: Hit/miss ratios

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Daily health check
python -m app.main status

# Weekly performance review
python -c "
from app.core.data.collectors.enhanced_market_data_collector import EnhancedMarketDataCollector
collector = EnhancedMarketDataCollector()
stats = collector.get_data_source_stats()
print('Weekly Stats:', stats)
"
```

### Alert Thresholds
- IG Markets API failure rate > 5%
- Average response time > 2 seconds
- Fallback usage > 30%
- Cache miss rate > 50%

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. **Immediate Fallback**:
   ```python
   # Disable IG Markets temporarily
   export IG_DEMO=true  # Use demo mode
   # or
   export IG_DISABLE=true  # Force yfinance only
   ```

2. **Service Restart**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart trading-system
   python -m app.main status
   ```

3. **Full Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push production main
   sudo systemctl restart trading-system
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Production Tuning
1. **Cache Settings**:
   - Increase cache duration during market close
   - Implement Redis for distributed caching
   - Add cache warming for pre-market

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Configure production API limits

3. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Use requests.Session for persistent connections
   - Configure connection timeout settings
   - Implement connection retry logic

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- [ ] Store credentials in secure vault
- [ ] Implement API key rotation
- [ ] Add IP whitelisting for production
- [ ] Enable audit logging for API calls

### Application Security
- [ ] Validate all input data
- [ ] Sanitize API responses
- [ ] Implement request signing
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user
