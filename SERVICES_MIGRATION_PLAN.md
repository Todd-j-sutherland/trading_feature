# Services Transformation Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step migration from the current bloated system (717 Python files) to a clean, services-rich architecture.

## Current State (Before Transformation)

### File Count Analysis
- **Total Python files**: 717
- **Root directory files**: 200+
- **Core app directory**: ~100 files
- **Scattered utilities**: ~300 files
- **Legacy/duplicate files**: ~200+ files

### Major Issues
1. **Monolithic structure** - Everything mixed together
2. **Duplicate functionality** - Multiple versions of similar components
3. **No clear boundaries** - Services tightly coupled
4. **Hard to maintain** - Changes affect multiple unrelated areas
5. **Difficult deployment** - Cannot deploy components independently

## Target State (After Transformation)

### Services Architecture
```
services/
├── trading-service/        # Core trading logic (Port 8001)
├── sentiment-service/      # News sentiment analysis (Port 8002)
├── ml-service/            # Machine learning predictions (Port 8003)
├── data-service/          # Data collection and management (Port 8004)
├── dashboard-service/     # UI and visualization (Port 8005)
└── orchestrator.py        # Service coordination (Port 8000)
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **90% file reduction** (from 717 to ~70-100 core files)
- **Independent deployability** of each service
- **Clear service boundaries** and APIs
- **Better testability** through isolation
- **Improved maintainability** with focused responsibilities

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create feature branch `feature/services-transformation`
- [x] Design services architecture
- [x] Create shared models and utilities
- [x] Setup Docker composition
- [x] Create service startup/stop scripts

### Phase 2: Extract Core Services ✅ IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Sentiment Service** - News collection and sentiment analysis
- [ ] **ML Service** - Machine learning models and predictions
- [ ] **Data Service** - Market data collection and storage
- [ ] **Dashboard Service** - Web UI and visualization

### Phase 3: Service Integration
- [ ] Implement service-to-service communication
- [ ] Add comprehensive health checks

- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

### Phase 4: Migration from Legacy
- [ ] Map existing functionality to services
- [ ] Create migration scripts
- [ ] Update configuration
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflows

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Archive legacy files
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Validate system performance

## File Mapping: Legacy → Services

### Trading Components
**Legacy Files** → **New Service**
```
app/core/trading/paper_trading.py → services/trading-service/core/
app/core/trading/position_tracker.py → services/trading-service/core/
app/core/trading/risk_management.py → services/trading-service/core/
app/core/trading/signals.py → services/trading-service/core/
```

### Sentiment Analysis
**Legacy Files** → **New Service**
```
app/core/sentiment/news_analyzer.py → services/sentiment-service/core/
app/core/sentiment/enhanced_scoring.py → services/sentiment-service/core/
app/core/sentiment/temporal_analyzer.py → services/sentiment-service/core/
```

### Machine Learning
**Legacy Files** → **New Service**
```
app/core/ml/enhanced_training_pipeline.py → services/ml-service/core/
app/core/ml/ensemble_predictor.py → services/ml-service/core/
app/core/ml/prediction/ → services/ml-service/core/prediction/
```

### Data Management
**Legacy Files** → **New Service**
```
app/core/data/collectors/ → services/data-service/core/collectors/
app/core/data/processors/ → services/data-service/core/processors/
app/core/data/validators/ → services/data-service/core/validators/
```

## Service APIs

### Trading Service (Port 8001)
```
GET  /health                    # Health check
GET  /positions                 # Get all positions
POST /positions                 # Open new position
DELETE /positions/{id}          # Close position
POST /signals/{symbol}          # Generate trading signal
GET  /portfolio                 # Portfolio summary
```

### Sentiment Service (Port 8002)
```
GET  /health                    # Health check
GET  /sentiment/{symbol}        # Get sentiment score
GET  /news/{symbol}             # Get recent news
GET  /market-sentiment          # Overall market sentiment
POST /sentiment/bulk            # Bulk sentiment analysis
```

### Orchestrator (Port 8000)
```
GET  /health                    # System health check
GET  /recommend/{symbol}        # Comprehensive trading recommendation
GET  /services                  # List all services
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each service has its own test suite:
```
services/trading-service/tests/
services/sentiment-service/tests/
services/ml-service/tests/
```

### Integration Testing
```
tests/integration/
├── test_service_communication.py
├── test_trading_workflow.py
├── test_sentiment_integration.py
└── test_orchestrator.py
```

### End-to-End Testing
```
tests/e2e/
├── test_complete_trading_flow.py
├── test_service_resilience.py
└── test_performance.py
```

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
# Start all services
./services/start_services.sh

# Stop all services
./services/stop_services.sh
```

### Production (Docker)
```bash
# Build and start
docker-compose up -d

# Scale services
docker-compose up --scale sentiment-service=3

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility per service
- Easy to locate and fix issues
