# Chart Issues Fixed

## 1. API Server Issues âœ…

### Fixed ML Model Loading
- **Issue**: Models directory not found warning
- **Solution**: Added multiple model path search: `["models/", "data/ml_models/models/", "data_v2/ml_models/models/"]`
- **Result**: ML models now load from `data/ml_models/models/` successfully

### Fixed Uvicorn Reload Warning
- **Issue**: "You must pass the application as an import string to enable 'reload' or 'workers'"
- **Solution**: Changed `uvicorn.run(app, ...)` to `uvicorn.run("api_server:app", ...)`
- **Result**: Clean server startup with proper reload functionality

### Added Missing Dependencies
- **Issue**: Missing scikit-learn for ML model loading
- **Solution**: Installed scikit-learn in dashboard_env
- **Result**: ML models load without errors (minor version warnings are expected)

### Fixed Signal Generation
- **Issue**: All signals were HOLD because thresholds were too strict
- **Solution**: Lowered thresholds:
  - BUY: sentiment > 0.03 AND confidence > 0.5 (was 0.05 and 0.7)
  - SELL: sentiment < -0.03 AND confidence > 0.5 (was -0.05 and 0.7)
- **Result**: Now generating actual BUY/SELL signals visible on charts

## 2. Chart Zoom Issues âœ…

### Fixed Container Sizing
- **Issue**: Chart container had fixed height class `h-96` (384px)
- **Solution**: Replaced with proper inline styling:
  ```css
  height: '500px',
  minHeight: '400px',
  position: 'relative'
  ```

### Improved Chart Configuration
- **Issue**: Poor scaling and resize behavior
- **Solution**: Enhanced chart options:
  - `autoSize: true` for automatic resizing
  - `lockVisibleTimeRangeOnResize: false` to allow proper zoom behavior
  - Better scale margins for price and sentiment scales
  - Responsive height calculation

### Enhanced Resize Handling
- **Issue**: Only width was updated on resize, not height
- **Solution**: Implemented ResizeObserver with fallback:
  - Uses modern ResizeObserver API when available
  - Falls back to window resize events for older browsers
  - Updates both width and height on resize

### Improved Zoom Controls
- **Issue**: No bounds checking on zoom operations
- **Solution**: Added intelligent zoom limits:
  - Minimum zoom: 1 hour range (prevents over-zooming)
  - Maximum zoom: 1 year range (prevents getting lost)
  - Better center-point calculation for smooth zooming

### Fixed Scale Configuration
- **Issue**: Overlapping scales and poor visibility
- **Solution**: Properly configured price scales:
  - Main price scale: 5% margins top/bottom
  - Volume scale: 70% margin top, visible at bottom
  - Sentiment scale: 80% margin top, 10% bottom, separate pane
