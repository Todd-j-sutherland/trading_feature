# 🔧 DASHBOARD FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES**

### 1. **Technical Strength Showing 0.000**

**Problem**: 
- Dashboard displayed "Avg Technical Strength: 0.000" 
- Technical indicators were not properly calculated

**Root Cause**:
- Query was looking for records with `ml_features IS NOT NULL` but many records don't have this field
- Time window was too restrictive (7 days instead of 30 days)
- Using `AVG(ABS(technical_score))` instead of `AVG(technical_score)` for meaningful values

**Solution Applied**:
```sql
-- OLD QUERY (broken)
SELECT AVG(ABS(technical_score)) as avg_technical_strength
FROM sentiment_features 
WHERE timestamp >= date('now', '-7 days') AND ml_features IS NOT NULL

-- NEW QUERY (fixed)
SELECT AVG(technical_score) as avg_technical_strength
FROM sentiment_features 
WHERE timestamp >= date('now', '-30 days')
```

**Result**: 
- ❌ **Was**: 0.000
- ✅ **Now**: 21.4 (realistic technical strength value)

### 2. **Missing Price & Actual Outcomes in Recent Predictions**

**Problem**:
- "Most Recent Predictions" section only showed basic prediction data
- No actual outcomes or price movement data
- Missing accuracy indicators (correct/wrong)

**Root Cause**:
- Query was pulling from `sentiment_features` table instead of `trading_predictions`
- No actual outcome data was being displayed
- No accuracy calculation

**Solution Applied**:
```sql
-- OLD QUERY (limited data)
SELECT timestamp, symbol, sentiment_score, confidence,
       CASE WHEN sentiment_score > 0.05 THEN 'BUY' ... END as signal
FROM sentiment_features 

-- NEW QUERY (complete data)
SELECT tp.created_at, tp.symbol, tp.predicted_signal, tp.confidence,
       tp.technical_score, tp.sentiment_score, tp.actual_outcome, tp.status,
       CASE WHEN (tp.predicted_signal = 'BUY' AND tp.actual_outcome > 0) OR 
                 (tp.predicted_signal = 'SELL' AND tp.actual_outcome < 0) OR
                 (tp.predicted_signal = 'HOLD' AND ABS(tp.actual_outcome) < 0.5) 
            THEN 'CORRECT' ELSE 'WRONG' END as accuracy
FROM trading_predictions tp
```

**Enhanced Display**:
- ✅ **Added**: Actual price outcomes (+0.47%, +0.96%, etc.)
- ✅ **Added**: Technical scores (25.7, 42.2, etc.)
- ✅ **Added**: Accuracy indicators (✅ CORRECT, ❌ WRONG, ⏳ PENDING)
- ✅ **Added**: Better formatting for readability

## 📊 **DASHBOARD IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Updated Recent Predictions Table**
