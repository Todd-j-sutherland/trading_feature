- **Database**: 13 tables with active data ‚úÖ
- **ML Models**: All operational ‚úÖ
- **Commands**: All starting successfully ‚úÖ

### Resolution
The "errors" in the previous log were due to testing in the wrong directory. The actual trading system in `/root/test/` is **fully functional** and ready for use.

## üí° Key Takeaway
