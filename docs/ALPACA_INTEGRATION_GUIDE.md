# 🏢 Trading Platform Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Trading Platform Options**

You have two main options for automated trading with your ML system:

### **🇺🇸 Option 1: Alpaca (US Markets) - Current Setup**
- **Purpose:** Learning automation, testing strategies
- **Trades:** US bank stocks as proxies for ASX banks
- **Accuracy:** Limited due to cross-market mapping
- **Status:** ✅ Already configured and working

### **🇦🇺 Option 2: Moomoo Australia (ASX Markets) - RECOMMENDED**
- **Purpose:** Accurate trading of actual ASX banks
- **Trades:** Direct ASX stocks (CBA.AX, WBC.AX, ANZ.AX, NAB.AX)
- **Accuracy:** 100% - trades exactly what your ML analyzes
- **Status:** 🆕 [See detailed setup guide](./MOOMOO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

---

## 🏆 **RECOMMENDED: Start with Moomoo Australia**

For accurate trading that matches your ML analysis, see the comprehensive setup guide:

**📖 [Moomoo Australia Integration Guide](./MOOMOO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)**

This guide covers:
- ✅ Complete account setup process
- ✅ Where to get API keys
- ✅ Paper trading activation ($1M virtual cash)
- ✅ Algorithmic trading platform setup
- ✅ Integration with your existing ML system

---

## �🇸 **Alpaca Configuration (Alternative Option)**

**Note:** Alpaca is useful for learning automation, but Moomoo Australia is recommended for accurate ASX trading.

### **Account Details:**
- **API Key:** `PK3P9BT5KOXAFGFOY049`
- **Base URL:** `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2`
- **Account Type:** Paper Trading (Safe for testing)

### **⚠️ Missing Information Needed:**
You need to get your **SECRET KEY** from your Alpaca dashboard to complete the setup.

---

## 🚀 **Alpaca Setup Instructions (If Using This Option)**

**⚠️ Recommended Alternative:** For accurate ASX trading, use [Moomoo Australia](./MOOMOO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) instead.

### **Step 1: Get Your Alpaca Secret Key**

1. **Login to Alpaca Dashboard:**
   - Go to [https://app.alpaca.markets/](https://app.alpaca.markets/)
   - Login with your account credentials

2. **Navigate to API Keys:**
   - Click on your profile/account menu
   - Select **"API Keys"** or **"Settings"** → **"API Keys"**

3. **Find Your Secret Key:**
   - You'll see your **API Key ID:** `PK3P9BT5KOXAFGFOY049` (already configured)
   - Look for **"Secret Key"** - this is what you need
   - The secret key is typically longer and starts with letters/numbers
   - **⚠️ Important:** Keep this secret key secure and never share it

4. **Copy the Secret Key:**
   - Click the "Copy" button next to your secret key
   - Save it temporarily in a secure location

### **Step 2: Run Setup Script**
```bash
# This will guide you through the complete setup
python setup_alpaca.py
```

When prompted, paste your secret key from Step 1.

### **Step 3: Test Connection**
```bash
# Test your Alpaca connection
python app/main.py alpaca-test
```

### **Step 4: Integration Options**

#### **Option A: Manual Trading (Recommended to Start)**
```bash
# Check ML scores
python app/main.py ml-scores

# Analyze specific bank before trading
python app/main.py pre-trade --symbol ANZ.AX

# Execute trades manually based on analysis
```

#### **Option B: Automated Trading (Advanced)**
```bash
# Start continuous trading service (runs all day)
python app/main.py start-trading
```

## 📊 **How It Works with Your ML System**

### **ASX to US Stock Mapping**
Since Alpaca only trades US stocks, your system maps ASX banks to similar US banks:

| **Your ASX Bank** | **US Equivalent** | **Company** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| CBA.AX | BAC | Bank of America |
| WBC.AX | WFC | Wells Fargo |
| ANZ.AX | JPM | JPMorgan Chase |
| NAB.AX | C | Citigroup |
| MQG.AX | GS | Goldman Sachs |

### **ML-Based Trading Logic**
1. **ML Analysis:** Your system analyzes ASX bank sentiment
2. **Score Calculation:** Generates ML scores (0-100) and confidence levels
3. **US Mapping:** Maps to equivalent US bank stocks
4. **Trade Execution:** Places paper trades based on ML recommendations

### **Trading Rules (Built-in Safety)**
- **Minimum ML Score:** 40+ for any trades
- **High Risk Filter:** Requires 60+ score for high-risk trades
- **Position Sizing:** Based on confidence and ML score
- **Max Exposure:** $10,000 total across all positions
- **Time Limits:** Minimum 30 minutes between trade cycles

---

## ⚠️ **Important Limitation: ASX→US Mapping Accuracy**

### **Why the Current Setup May Be Inaccurate**
You're absolutely right! The ASX→US bank mapping has significant limitations:

**🕐 Market Timing Issues:**
- **ASX Trading:** 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM AEST (overlaps with US pre-market only)
- **US Markets:** 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (different time zones)
- **Your ML Analysis:** Based on ASX bank news at Australian market hours
- **Trading Execution:** Happens in US markets with different drivers

**📊 Different Economic Factors:**
- **ASX Banks:** Affected by RBA rates, Australian housing, local regulations
- **US Banks:** Affected by Fed rates, US housing, different regulatory environment
- **Currency Impact:** AUD/USD movements affect performance differently

**📰 News Sentiment Mismatch:**
- Your ML analyzes CBA, WBC, ANZ, NAB news
- But trades BAC, WFC, JPM, C based on that analysis
- US banks may have completely different news cycles

### **🇦🇺 Australian Alternatives (More Accurate)**

**🏆 Option 1: Moomoo Australia (RECOMMENDED)**
- ✅ **Perfect ASX Access:** Direct trading of actual ASX bank stocks (CBA.AX, WBC.AX, ANZ.AX, NAB.AX)
- ✅ **$1M Paper Trading:** Virtual cash for risk-free testing with real market conditions
- ✅ **Full Algo Trading:** Built-in algorithmic trading platform + OpenAPI access
- ✅ **Same Market Hours:** Perfect sync with your ML analysis (10AM-4PM AEST)
- ✅ **ASIC Regulated:** Australian Financial Services License (AFSL No. 224663)
- ✅ **Low Fees:** $3 per order for ASX stocks, competitive brokerage
- 🔧 **Setup:** Free account signup, no minimum deposit for paper trading

**Option 2: Interactive Brokers Australia**
- ✅ **ASX Access:** Direct trading of actual ASX bank stocks
- ✅ **Paper Trading:** Demo accounts available
- ✅ **API Access:** Full API for automated trading
- ✅ **Lower Fees:** Competitive Australian brokerage
- 🔧 **Setup Required:** New account, different API integration

**Option 3: CommSec API (Commonwealth Bank)**
- ✅ **Pure ASX Trading:** Trade the actual banks your ML analyzes
- ✅ **Paper Trading:** Virtual portfolio features available
- ✅ **Same Market Hours:** No timing mismatch issues
- 🔧 **Limitations:** More restricted API access for retail clients

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
```bash
# Keep Alpaca for learning/testing the automation
python app/main.py alpaca-test

# Use ASX data for real trading decisions
python app/main.py ml-scores  # Your actual ASX analysis
# Then manually trade via CommSec/IBKR based on ML signals
```
