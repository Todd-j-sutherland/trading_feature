# ML Trading System Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document explains the comprehensive ML trading system implementation that was added to the trading analysis platform. The system provides advanced sentiment analysis, ML-powered trading scores, pre-trade analysis, and Alpaca integration for automated trading.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ML Trading Manager** (`app/core/ml/trading_manager.py`)
   - Central orchestrator for all ML trading operations
   - Coordinates sentiment analysis, economic analysis, divergence detection, and ML scoring
   - Provides unified interface for pre-trade analysis

2. **ML Trading Scorer** (`app/core/ml/trading_scorer.py`)
   - Calculates comprehensive ML scores using 6 components:
     - Sentiment Strength (0-100)
     - Sentiment Confidence (0-100)
     - Economic Context (0-100)
     - Divergence Score (0-100)
     - Technical Momentum (0-100)
     - ML Prediction Confidence (0-100)

3. **Enhanced News Sentiment Analyzer** (`app/core/sentiment/news_analyzer.py`)
   - Multi-source news aggregation (RSS, Yahoo Finance, web scraping)
   - Advanced transformer-based sentiment analysis
   - ML trading features integration
   - Enhanced sentiment scoring with market context

4. **Economic Sentiment Analyzer** (`app/core/analysis/economic.py`)
   - Market regime detection (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral)
   - Economic sentiment scoring (-1 to +1)
   - Market context analysis

5. **Divergence Detector** (`app/core/analysis/divergence.py`)
   - Sector-wide sentiment divergence analysis
   - Identifies outlier banks with unusual sentiment patterns
   - Provides divergence scores and sector averages

6. **Alpaca Trading Integration** (`app/core/trading/alpaca_integration.py`)
   - Paper trading integration with Alpaca Markets
   - Automated order placement based on ML scores
   - Position management and risk controls

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Critical Error: 'NewsSentimentAnalyzer' object has no attribute 'get_all_news'

**Problem:** The system was crashing with a missing method error.

**Solution:** Added the `get_all_news()` method to aggregate news from multiple sources:

```python
def get_all_news(self, search_terms: list, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Collect news from all available sources for the given symbol and search terms.
    """
    all_news = []
    
    # Fetch from RSS feeds
    rss_news = self._fetch_rss_news(symbol)
    all_news.extend(rss_news)
    
    # Fetch from Yahoo News
    yahoo_news = self._fetch_yahoo_news(symbol)
    all_news.extend(yahoo_news)
    
    # Scrape from news websites
    scraped_news = self._scrape_news_sites(symbol)
    all_news.extend(scraped_news)
    
    # Remove duplicates
    all_news = self._remove_duplicate_news(all_news)
    
    return all_news
```

### 2. Fixed Transformer Models Attribute Error

**Problem:** Code was trying to access `transformer_models` but the attribute was named `transformer_pipelines`.

**Solution:** Updated the sentiment analysis method to use the correct attribute:

```python
# Fixed line 1724 in news_analyzer.py
if self.transformer_pipelines.get('general'):
    transformer_result = self.transformer_pipelines['general'](text)
```

### 3. Added Missing ML Trading Component Initialization

**Problem:** Missing `feature_engineer`, `reddit`, and other ML-related attributes causing AttributeError.

**Solution:** Added proper initialization in the `NewsSentimentAnalyzer.__init__()` method:

```python
# Initialize ML trading components
self.feature_engineer = None
self.reddit = None
self.ml_model = None
self.enhanced_integration = None

# Try to initialize ML trading components
if ML_TRADING_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        self.feature_engineer = FeatureEngineer()
        logger.info("FeatureEngineer initialized successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to initialize FeatureEngineer: {e}")
        self.feature_engineer = None

# Try to initialize enhanced sentiment integration
if ENHANCED_SENTIMENT_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        self.enhanced_integration = SentimentIntegrationManager()
        logger.info("Enhanced sentiment integration initialized successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to initialize enhanced sentiment integration: {e}")
        self.enhanced_integration = None

# Load ML model if available
self.ml_model = self._load_ml_model()
```

### 4. Added Reddit Sentiment Analysis

**Problem:** `reddit_sentiment` variable was undefined in the sentiment calculation.

**Solution:** Added call to `_get_reddit_sentiment()` method:

```python
# Get Reddit sentiment
reddit_sentiment = self._get_reddit_sentiment(symbol)
```

### 5. Enhanced CLI Commands

Added new CLI commands for ML trading functionality:

- `ml-scores` - Display ML scores for all banks
- `pre-trade --symbol SYMBOL` - Run pre-trade analysis for specific symbol
- `dashboard --enhanced` - Launch enhanced dashboard with ML features

## How to Run the System

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.11 or 3.12 (recommended for full transformer support)
2. **Virtual Environment**: Activate the project's virtual environment
3. **Dependencies**: All required packages should be installed via `requirements.txt`

### Basic Commands

1. **Activate Environment**:
   ```bash
   source .venv312/bin/activate
   cd /Users/toddsutherland/Repos/trading_analysis
   ```

2. **Run ML Scores Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py ml-scores
   ```
   This displays ML trading scores for all configured bank stocks.

3. **Run Pre-Trade Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py pre-trade --symbol QBE.AX
   ```
   Replace `QBE.AX` with any supported bank symbol (CBA.AX, WBC.AX, ANZ.AX, NAB.AX, etc.)

4. **Launch Enhanced Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py enhanced-dashboard
   ```

5. **Run Complete Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py analyze
   ```

### Supported Bank Symbols
