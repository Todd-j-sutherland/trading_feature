- `--symbols` for multi-symbol analysis
- `--use-real-ml` / `--use-mock-ml` options
- Multiple mutually exclusive argument groups

## ✅ What Remains (Core Stable Functions)

### Essential Commands
```bash
python -m app.main morning              # Morning routine
python -m app.main evening              # Evening routine  
python -m app.main status               # Quick status check
python -m app.main news                 # News sentiment analysis
python -m app.main divergence           # Sector divergence analysis
python -m app.main economic             # Economic analysis
```

### Analysis & Testing
```bash
python -m app.main backtest             # Comprehensive backtesting
python -m app.main simple-backtest      # Lightweight backtesting
python -m app.main weekly               # Weekly maintenance
python -m app.main restart              # Emergency restart
python -m app.main test                 # Test enhanced features
```

### Configuration Options
```bash
--config CONFIG                         # Custom configuration file
--verbose, -v                          # Enable verbose logging
--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}  # Set logging level
--symbol SYMBOL                         # Symbol for analysis
```

## 🎯 Core Focus Areas

### 1. **Morning Routine** 
- Stable morning analysis and data collection
- News sentiment processing
- Market preparation

### 2. **Continual Scraping**
- Ongoing news collection and processing
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Data quality monitoring

### 3. **Evening Routine**
- End-of-day analysis and reporting
- Data consolidation and cleanup
- Performance review

## 📊 System Status Verification

The simplified system is now working correctly:

```bash
$ python3 -m app.main status
📊 QUICK STATUS CHECK - AI-Powered Trading System

### 3. **Performance**
- Faster startup (no complex imports)
- Reduced memory footprint
- More predictable behavior

### 4. **Reliability**
- Eliminated trading execution complexity
- Removed external API dependencies (Alpaca)
- Focused on analysis and monitoring

## 📁 File Changes

- **Replaced:** `app/main.py` with simplified version
- **Backed up:** Original as `app/main_backup.py`
- **Reduced:** 600+ lines → 315 lines (47% reduction)
- **Commands:** 20+ commands → 11 essential commands

## 🔄 Next Steps

With the simplified main.py:

1. **Morning Routine**: Focus on stable morning data collection
2. **Continual Scraping**: Ensure reliable ongoing news processing  
3. **Evening Routine**: Consolidate and analyze daily data
4. **Debugging**: Much easier to isolate issues with fewer moving parts

The system is now **clean, focused, and ready** for stable morning/evening operations with continual scraping! 🎯
