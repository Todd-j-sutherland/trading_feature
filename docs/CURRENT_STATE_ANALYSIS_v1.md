Great question! Let me explain what **Divergence Scores** mean in your trading analysis system. Looking at your system, divergence scores are a key component of your ML trading signals. Summarized conversation historyNow let me look for the specific implementation of how divergence scores are calculated: Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of what **Divergence Scores** mean in your trading system. Let me explain:

## 🎯 **Divergence Scores Explained**

**Divergence Scores** in your trading system measure how much an individual bank's sentiment **differs from the overall banking sector average**. This is a powerful trading signal because it helps identify:

### **What Divergence Measures:**

1. **Individual vs. Sector Performance**
   - How much a specific bank (like ANZ.AX) differs from the average sentiment of all banks
   - Calculated as: `Bank Sentiment - Sector Average Sentiment`

2. **Normalized & Confidence-Adjusted**
   - Raw divergence is normalized by sector volatility
   - Then adjusted by the confidence level of the analysis
   - Formula: `(Raw Divergence / Sector Volatility) × Confidence`

### **Divergence Score Interpretation:**

| **Score Range** | **Meaning** | **Trading Implication** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **+0.15 to +3.0** | **Positive Outlier** | Bank performing **better** than sector - potential **BUY** |
| **-0.15 to -3.0** | **Negative Outlier** | Bank performing **worse** than sector - potential **SELL** |
| **-0.15 to +0.15** | **In Line** | Bank following sector trend - **HOLD** |

### **Key Components:**

1. **Divergence Score**: The actual difference from sector average
2. **Significance**: How statistically meaningful the divergence is (1.0-3.0 scale)
3. **Opportunity Type**: 
   - `outperformer` - beats sector average
   - `underperformer` - lags sector average
   - `in_line` - follows sector

### **Why This Matters for Trading:**

**Divergence identifies opportunities others might miss:**

- **Positive Divergence** (+0.3): "ANZ has +0.3 sentiment while sector average is 0.0" → ANZ showing relative strength
- **Negative Divergence** (-0.4): "CBA has -0.2 sentiment while sector average is +0.2" → CBA showing relative weakness

### **In Your ML Trading Score:**

The divergence score becomes one of 6 components in your overall ML trading score (0-100):

1. Sentiment Strength (0-100)
2. Sentiment Confidence (0-100) 
3. Economic Context (0-100)
4. **Divergence Score (0-100)** ← This one!
5. Technical Momentum (0-100)
6. ML Prediction Confidence (0-100)

### **Real Example:**
If CBA has sentiment of +0.5 and the sector average is +0.2:
- **Raw Divergence**: +0.3 (CBA is 0.3 points above sector)
- **Divergence Type**: "positive_outlier" 
- **Opportunity**: "outperformer"
- **Trading Signal**: Potential **BUY** (CBA showing relative strength)

This helps you spot banks that are moving independently of the sector trend - often the most profitable trading opportunities! 📈
