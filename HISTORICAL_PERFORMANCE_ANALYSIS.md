## üö® Regression Analysis: What Changed?

### Before (August 2025) ‚úÖ
```json
"signal_distribution": {
  "BUY": 166,
  "SELL": 134, 
  "HOLD": 0
}
```

### Now (September 2025) ‚ùå
```json
"signal_distribution": {
  "BUY": 0,
  "SELL": 0,
  "HOLD": 100%
}
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The dramatic shift from **0% HOLD** to **100% HOLD** indicates:

1. **Volume Pipeline Failure**: Historical data shows volume features were working
2. **Threshold Changes**: Decision logic became overly conservative  
3. **Data Timing Issues**: YFinance delays causing stale data decisions
4. **Model Regression**: Possible model file corruption or version rollback

- [ ] **Fix volume pipeline**: Restore volume_features calculation
- [ ] **Update cron timing**: Align with ASX market hours (not midnight UTC)
- [ ] **Validate data sources**: Ensure yfinance data freshness

### Validation Tests
- [ ] **Signal Generation Test**: Should produce BUY/SELL signals with test data
- [ ] **Volume Features Test**: Should return non-zero values
- [ ] **Confidence Range Test**: Should show 65-80% confidence (not 47-60%)
- [ ] **Historical Replay Test**: Run August data through current system
