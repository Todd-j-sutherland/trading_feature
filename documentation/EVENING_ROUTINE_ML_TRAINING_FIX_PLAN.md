# Evening Routine ML Training Fix Plan
*Created: August 25, 2025*
*Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION*

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Issue 1: Complete ML Model Failure**
- **Problem**: All ML models missing for all symbols
- **Error**: `ML models not available for CBA.AX: missing direction model, magnitude model, metadata`
- **Impact**: No ML predictions possible, system falling back to manual analysis
- **Root Cause**: Model files don't exist or training pipeline never executed successfully

### **Issue 2: Feature Vector Population Failure**
- **Problem**: All 28 predictions today have empty feature vectors (0/28)
- **Error**: Technical analysis working but not persisting to prediction records
- **Impact**: No training data being created for future ML model training
- **Root Cause**: Disconnect between data collection and database storage

### **Issue 3: Training Data Pipeline Disconnect**
- **Problem**: System reports "0 samples" despite 117 predictions with outcomes available
- **Error**: `Insufficient enhanced training data: 0 samples (minimum: 50)`
- **Impact**: No model training occurring even with sufficient historical data
- **Root Cause**: Training pipeline not accessing existing prediction/outcome data

### **Issue 4: Enhanced System Not Active**
- **Problem**: enhanced_efficient_system.py created but not running in production
- **Error**: Cron job likely still using old memory-intensive system
- **Impact**: Technical analysis not being applied during market hours
- **Root Cause**: System optimization not deployed to production

### **Issue 5: Prediction Timing Gaps**
- **Problem**: Predictions stopped at 11:31 AM, missing 4.5 hours of market data
- **Error**: No predictions during critical market hours (11:31 AM - 4:00 PM)
- **Impact**: Lost trading opportunities and incomplete data collection
- **Root Cause**: Prediction system failure during market hours
