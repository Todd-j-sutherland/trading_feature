# 📊 Trading Dashboard Guide - Simple Explanations

**A complete walkthrough of your ASX Banks Trading Dashboard in everyday language**

---

## 🎯 **What This Dashboard Does**

Your dashboard monitors **7 Australian bank stocks** (CBA, ANZ, WBC, NAB, MQG, SUN, QBE) and uses artificial intelligence to predict whether their prices will go up, down, or stay the same.

Think of it like a **weather forecast for bank stocks** - instead of predicting rain or sunshine, it predicts whether stock prices will rise or fall.
