# MCP Integration Status & Alternatives

## Current Reality Check üö®

**VS Code Copilot Chat MCP integration is VERY experimental** and may not be fully available in current releases. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Check VS Code Insiders üß™
Try VS Code Insiders (development version) which has newer experimental features:
```bash
# Download VS Code Insiders from https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/
```

## Option 2: Use Claude Desktop (Recommended) ‚úÖ
Claude Desktop has stable MCP support:

1. **Install Claude Desktop** from https://claude.ai/download
2. **Configure MCP** in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "asx-trading-system": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/toddsutherland/Repos/trading_feature/mcp_server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 3: Test with MCP Inspector üîç
Use the official MCP debugging tool:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector /Users/toddsutherland/Repos/trading_feature/mcp_server/dist/index.js
```

## Option 4: Direct Integration üîå
Since your MCP server works perfectly, we can integrate it directly into this conversation by running it manually.

## Testing Your MCP Server Right Now ‚úÖ

Let's test your tools directly:

### Available Tools:
- `read_project_file` - Read any file from your trading system
- `list_directory` - Browse project structure  
- `get_system_status` - Check system health
- `get_quick_reference` - Get command references
- `explain_file_purpose` - Understand file purposes
- `get_system_architecture` - Get architecture overview
- `get_validation_framework_info` - Get validation details

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test the MCP server directly
cd /Users/toddsutherland/Repos/trading_feature/mcp_server
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | node dist/index.js

# Get system architecture
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_system_architecture"}}' | node dist/index.js
```

## Recommendation üí°

1. **For immediate use**: Test with Claude Desktop (most reliable)
2. **For VS Code**: Wait for stable MCP release or try VS Code Insiders
3. **For development**: Your MCP server works perfectly and is ready when VS Code catches up

Your MCP server is built correctly and functioning - the integration point is what's experimental!
