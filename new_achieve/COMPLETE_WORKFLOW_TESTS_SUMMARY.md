## 🧪 **Specific Integration Scenarios Tested**

### **Scenario 1: Complete Daily Cycle**
```python
def test_morning_to_evening_complete_cycle():
    # STEP 1: Morning analysis creates features
    morning_features = simulate_morning_analysis()
    
    # STEP 2: Market activity occurs (time passage)
    # STEP 3: Evening analysis records outcomes
    evening_outcomes = simulate_evening_analysis(morning_features)
    
    # STEP 4: Validate data relationships and quality
    validate_feature_outcome_relationships()
    validate_return_calculations()  # Post-fix validation
```

### **Scenario 2: ML Training Data Pipeline**
```python
def test_ml_training_pipeline_integration():
    # Prepare comprehensive training dataset
    X, y = pipeline.prepare_enhanced_training_dataset(min_samples=50)
    
    # Train multi-output models
    results = pipeline.train_enhanced_models(X, y)
    
    # Validate model performance and persistence
    assert results['direction_accuracy']['1d'] > 0.6
    assert results['magnitude_mae']['1d'] < 5.0
```

### **Scenario 3: End-to-End Data Quality**
```python
def test_end_to_end_data_quality():
    # Validate feature-outcome relationships
    assert feature_count == outcome_count
    
    # Validate return calculation accuracy (critical post-fix)
    accuracy_rate = calculate_return_accuracy()
    assert accuracy_rate >= 99.9  # Should be near 100%
    
    # Validate realistic trading patterns
    assert 20 < buy_win_rate < 80  # Not 100% (bug pattern)
    assert 5 < sell_win_rate < 60  # Not 0% (bug pattern)
```

## 🛡️ **Return Calculation Bug Prevention**

All integration tests **specifically validate** the return calculation fix:

### **Database Accuracy Validation**
```python
def test_return_calculation_accuracy():
    # Get all stored vs calculated returns
    for entry_price, exit_price, stored_return in outcomes:
        expected_return = ((exit_price - entry_price) / entry_price) * 100
        assert abs(stored_return - expected_return) < 0.0001
```

### **Realistic Pattern Validation**
```python
def test_realistic_trading_patterns():
    buy_win_rate = calculate_buy_win_rate()
    sell_win_rate = calculate_sell_win_rate()
    
    # Detect bug patterns
    assert buy_win_rate != 100.0  # Should NOT be perfect
    assert sell_win_rate != 0.0   # Should NOT be zero
    
    # Validate realistic ranges
    assert 30 < buy_win_rate < 80
    assert 5 < sell_win_rate < 50
```

### **Calculation Formula Validation**
```python
def test_calculation_formula_consistency():
    # Ensure all components use the same correct formula
    python_calc = ((exit_price - entry_price) / entry_price) * 100
    sql_calc = stored_return_from_db
    
    assert abs(python_calc - sql_calc) < 0.0001
```

    ('WBC.AX', -0.4, -0.02, 'SELL'),  # Negative sentiment → price down → correct SELL  
    ('ANZ.AX', 0.1, 0.001, 'HOLD'),   # Neutral sentiment → small change → correct HOLD
    ('NAB.AX', 0.8, 0.045, 'BUY'),    # Strong sentiment → big move → correct BUY
    ('MQG.AX', -0.6, -0.035, 'SELL'), # Strong negative → big drop → correct SELL
