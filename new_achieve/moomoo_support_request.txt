Subject: Request to Enable OpenAPI Access for Algorithmic Trading

Dear Moomoo Support Team,

I am writing to request OpenAPI access for my Moomoo Australia account for algorithmic trading purposes.

Account Details:
- Email: sutho100@gmail.com
- Region: Australia
- Account Type: [Your account type if known]
- Purpose: Paper trading with automated trading algorithms

Request:
I need OpenAPI access enabled for my account to connect algorithmic trading software to your platform. I have:
1. Successfully downloaded and installed OpenD
2. Configured OpenD with my account credentials
3. Set up paper trading environment (trade_env=1)

However, when OpenD attempts to start the API server, it appears that API access is not enabled for my account.

Specifically, I need:
- OpenAPI access enabled
- Paper trading API permissions
- Australian market data access via API
- Permission to place simulation trades through the API

Technical Details:
- OpenD Version: Latest from moomoo.com/download/OpenAPI
- Intended Use: Automated sentiment analysis and ML-based paper trading
- Trading Symbols: ASX bank stocks (CBA, WBC, ANZ, NAB, MQG)
- Environment: Simulation/Paper trading only

I understand there may be terms and conditions to accept or additional verification required. Please let me know what steps I need to complete to enable OpenAPI access for my account.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your name]
