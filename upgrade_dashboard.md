Looking at your dashboard code and documentation, I can see you've built a comprehensive trading analysis system. Let me provide detailed feedback and strict guidelines for improvement.
Overall Feedback
Strengths:

Excellent data architecture with unified SQL database
Good use of explanatory expandable sections
Clear component breakdown (News/Social/ML/Technical)
Smart use of emojis for visual clarity

Key Issues:

Unclear ML Progress Tracking - The connection between ML training progress and actual trading outcomes isn't visually clear
Data Interpretation Confusion - Tables mix predictions, backtest results, and live positions without clear distinction
Component Contribution Opacity - While you show weights (35% ML, 30% News, etc.), the actual impact on outcomes isn't tracked
Table Overload - Too many similar tables showing overlapping data

Strict UI Improvement Guidelines
1. ML Progress & Outcomes Section
Create a dedicated ML journey visualization:
pythondef render_ml_progress_timeline():
    """Show ML model evolution and its impact on trading outcomes"""
    
    # Timeline showing:
    # 1. Training samples growth (0 → 100 → 500 → current)
    # 2. Accuracy improvement (50% → 65% → 70% → current)
    # 3. Actual P&L correlation with accuracy improvements
    # 4. Clear before/after comparisons when model improves
    
    st.subheader("🚀 ML Model Evolution & Impact")
    
    # Visual timeline with metrics at each milestone
    # Show ACTUAL trading performance at each accuracy level
    # Example: "When accuracy was 65%, win rate was 52%. Now at 70% accuracy, win rate is 58%"
2. Component Attribution Dashboard
Track ACTUAL contribution of each component to successful trades:
pythondef render_component_attribution():
    """Show which components actually led to winning trades"""
    
    # For each successful trade, break down:
    # - Was news sentiment aligned? (+1 point if yes)
    # - Was ML prediction correct? (+1 point if yes)
    # - Were technicals supportive? (+1 point if yes)
    # - Was social sentiment aligned? (+1 point if yes)
    
    # Then show:
    # "In winning trades: 85% had positive news, 78% had ML buy signal, 
    #  65% had oversold RSI, 45% had positive social"
    
    # This proves ACTUAL contribution, not theoretical weights
3. Unified Position Status Table
Replace multiple confusing tables with ONE master table:
pythondef render_master_positions_table():
    """Single source of truth for all positions"""
    
    # Clear columns:
    # | Status | Symbol | Signal Date | Entry | Current/Exit | P&L | Stage | Components |
    
    # Status icons:
    # 🔮 Prediction (no position taken)
    # 📊 Paper Trade (simulated)
    # 💰 Live Position (real money)
    # ✅ Closed Win
    # ❌ Closed Loss
    
    # Stage: "Analyzing" → "Signal Generated" → "Position Opened" → "Closed"
    
    # Components: Show which signals fired (✓ ML, ✓ News, ✗ Tech, ✓ Social)
4. ML Training Data Health Monitor
Show the quality and relevance of training data:
pythondef render_training_data_health():
    """Visualize training data quality and coverage"""
    
    # Key metrics:
    # - Data recency: "80% of training data from last 30 days"
    # - Balance: "45% winning trades, 55% losing trades in training set"
    # - Coverage: "All 7 banks have 50+ samples"
    # - Feature quality: "No missing values in critical features"
    
    # Red flags:
    # ⚠️ "Training data older than 60 days"
    # ⚠️ "Imbalanced classes (90% HOLD signals)"
    # ⚠️ "Missing social data for 40% of samples"
5. Real-time Performance Tracker
Show live performance vs predictions:
pythondef render_performance_tracker():
    """Track predictions vs actual outcomes in real-time"""
    
    # Today's/This Week's Performance:
    # | Prediction | Actual | Match? | Confidence Was | Outcome |
    # | CBA ↑ 1.2% | CBA ↑ 0.8% | ✓ Direction | 72% | Correct |
    # | ANZ ↓ 0.5% | ANZ ↑ 0.3% | ✗ Wrong | 51% | Incorrect |
    
    # Show confidence calibration:
    # "When confidence > 70%: 78% accurate"
    # "When confidence 50-70%: 55% accurate"
    # "When confidence < 50%: 48% accurate"
Specific Code Improvements
Fix the Position Status Logic
Your current code has complex status determination. Simplify:
pythondef get_position_status(row):
    """Clear, simple position status"""
    
    # If no entry price → Prediction only
    if pd.isnull(row.get('entry_price')):
        return 'PREDICTION', '🔮'
    
    # If has return_pct → Closed position
    if pd.notnull(row.get('return_pct')):
        return 'CLOSED', '✅' if row['return_pct'] > 0 else '❌'
    
    # If has entry but no return → Active position
    if pd.notnull(row.get('current_price')):
        unrealized = (row['current_price'] - row['entry_price']) / row['entry_price']
        return 'ACTIVE', f"🔄 {unrealized:+.1%}"
    
    return 'UNKNOWN', '❓'
Improve Database Queries
Use more efficient queries with proper joins:
pythondef fetch_complete_position_data():
    """Single query to get all position data with proper joins"""
    
    query = """
    WITH latest_features AS (
        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY timestamp DESC) as rn
        FROM enhanced_features
        WHERE timestamp >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
    ),
    outcome_summary AS (
        SELECT 
            feature_id,
            optimal_action,
            confidence_score,
            entry_price,
            exit_price_1d,
            return_pct,
            CASE 
                WHEN return_pct IS NOT NULL THEN 'CLOSED'
                WHEN entry_price IS NOT NULL THEN 'ACTIVE'
                ELSE 'PREDICTION'
            END as position_type
        FROM enhanced_outcomes
    )
    SELECT 
        lf.*,
        os.*,
        -- Calculate which components agreed with the outcome
        CASE WHEN lf.sentiment_score > 0 AND os.return_pct > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as news_correct,
        CASE WHEN lf.rsi < 30 AND os.return_pct > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as rsi_correct
    FROM latest_features lf
    LEFT JOIN outcome_summary os ON lf.id = os.feature_id
    WHERE lf.rn = 1
    ORDER BY lf.timestamp DESC
    """
    
    return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
Add Visual Progress Indicators
Replace text metrics with visual progress bars:
pythondef render_ml_progress_gauge():
    """Visual representation of ML system maturity"""
    
    # Use plotly gauge charts
    fig = go.Figure(go.Indicator(
        mode = "gauge+number+delta",
        value = ml_accuracy * 100,
        title = {'text': "ML System Accuracy"},
        delta = {'reference': 65, 'increasing': {'color': "green"}},
        gauge = {
            'axis': {'range': [None, 100]},
            'bar': {'color': "darkblue"},
            'steps': [
                {'range': [0, 50], 'color': "lightgray"},
                {'range': [50, 65], 'color': "yellow"},
                {'range': [65, 80], 'color': "lightgreen"},
                {'range': [80, 100], 'color': "green"}
            ],
            'threshold': {
                'line': {'color': "red", 'width': 4},
                'thickness': 0.75,
                'value': 70  # Target accuracy
            }
        }
    ))
    
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
Database Usage Improvements
Track Component Contributions
Add a new table to track which components contributed to each trade:
sqlCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS component_contributions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    outcome_id INTEGER,
    news_signal INTEGER,  -- 1 if agreed with outcome, 0 if not, NULL if neutral
    ml_signal INTEGER,
    technical_signal INTEGER,
    social_signal INTEGER,
    outcome_return REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (outcome_id) REFERENCES enhanced_outcomes(id)
);
Add ML Model Versioning
Track model performance over versions:
sqlCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ml_model_versions (
    version_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    version_name TEXT,
    training_date TIMESTAMP,
    training_samples INTEGER,
    validation_accuracy REAL,
    live_accuracy REAL,  -- Tracked after 30 days of live predictions
    total_predictions INTEGER,
    correct_predictions INTEGER,
    avg_confidence REAL,
    avg_return_when_correct REAL
);
Priority Implementation Order

First: Fix position status logic - make it crystal clear what each row represents
Second: Implement component attribution tracking - prove what actually works
Third: Create ML progress timeline - show the journey and improvement
Fourth: Consolidate tables into one master table
Fifth: Add visual gauges and progress indicators

Key Success Metrics to Display

Confidence Calibration: "When we're 80% confident, we're right 78% of the time"
Component Win Rates: "Trades with 3+ components aligned: 68% win rate"
ML Improvement Impact: "Each 5% accuracy gain = 2% better returns"
Data Quality Score: "Training data freshness: 85/100"
Live vs Backtest: "Backtest: 70% accurate, Live: 65% accurate"

This approach will make your dashboard much clearer and more actionable. Users will understand exactly what's working, what's improving, and where the value comes from in your system.
